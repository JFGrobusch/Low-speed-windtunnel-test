Use generate_thermal_images.py to generate grayscale jpeg images of thermal results.
Use generate_thermal_images_drastic.py to generate grayscale images which show the transition more clearly

1. Run generate_thermal_images_drastic.py or download images from repository. These images are needed to procede, as they are used in subsequent steps.
2. Run [].py to generate a plot of the transition procession
